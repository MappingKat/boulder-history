	    <p>by Robert Soden</p>

	    <p>The Boulder Historical Society and Museum was founded in 1944 by A.A. 'Gov' Paddock, then publisher of the Boulder Daily Camera. The organization, now called the Boulder History Museum, is located in the historic landmark Harbeck-Bergheim House on University Hill in Boulder, Colorado. A private-not-for-profit organization, it is governed by a board of trustees of 18 community leaders and has a staff of five.</p>

	    <p>Lame hours and a pretty bad selection but the only homebrew shop in town.  You'd think there'd be better options so I'm guessing most people mail-order.</p>
